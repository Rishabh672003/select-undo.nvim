# select-undo.nvim

## Overview

select-undo is a Neovim plugin that enhances undo functionality by allowing users to undo changes selectively. Unlike the default undo command, which reverts changes sequentially, Select-Undo enables users to undo specific lines or partial selections without affecting the rest of the file.



## Features
	â€¢	Persistent Undo: Ensures that undo history persists even after closing Neovim.
	â€¢	Selective Line Undo: Undo only the changes within selected lines (gu).
	â€¢	Partial Undo: Undo changes within a visual selection (gcu).
	â€¢	Visual Mode Integration: Works seamlessly with Neovimâ€™s visual mode for intuitive selection-based undo.
	â€¢	Customizable Keybindings: Default mappings are provided, but users can configure their own.
	â€¢	Undo by Line Number: Quickly undo a specific line using <C-s>u.

**This is still in development phase**

## Things that dont work properly

- If added a line in between two lines and reverted the line value is replaced by the very next line.
- If buffer is closed, undo doesnot work.

**Customizing Mappings**

You can override the default keybindings in the setup function:

  partial_mapping = "gCp" -- Change partial undo mapping
})
```

## Configuration

**Default Settings**

```
require("select-undo").setup({
  persistent_undo = true,  -- Enables persistent undo history
  mapping = true,          -- Enables default keybindings
  line_mapping = "gu",     -- Undo for entire lines
  partial_mapping = "gcu"  -- Undo for selected characters
})
```
